# RTL Implementation Guide for Nivaro Hebrew Website

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for converting your Nivaro website from LTR (Left-to-Right) to RTL (Right-to-Left) for Hebrew users.

## Files Created
- `rtl.css` - Comprehensive RTL stylesheet with ultra-specific selectors

## Quick Start

### 1. Test RTL Version
Visit: `http://localhost:8000/index-rtl.html`

### 2. Apply RTL to All Pages
```bash
./apply-rtl.sh
```

### 3. Manual Verification
Check the following elements:
- ✅ Text alignment (should be right-aligned)
- ✅ Navigation menu (should open from right)

## Hebrew Font Optimization

The RTL CSS includes optimized Hebrew fonts:
```css
font-family: 'Rubik', 'Arial', 'Tahoma', sans-serif;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Text Still Left-Aligned**
   - Check if rtl.css is loaded last
   - Verify `dir="rtl"` is set on `<html>` tag

2. **Layout Breaking**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check for conflicting inline styles
   - Verify CSS specificity

3. **Images Not Flipping**
   - Some images may need individual attention
   - Check for hardcoded `left`/`right` values

### Debug Steps
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Check Elements tab for RTL attributes
3. Verify CSS rules are being applied
4. Test with Hebrew placeholder text

## Hebrew Text Integration

When you're ready to add Hebrew text:

1. Replace English content with Hebrew text
2. Test readability with actual Hebrew content
3. Adjust font sizes if needed for Hebrew characters
4. Ensure proper line-height for Hebrew text

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert RTL changes:

```bash
# Restore from backups
find . -name '*.html.bak' -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%.bak}"' {} \;

# Or manually remove RTL attributes
# Remove: dir="rtl" from <html> tags
# Remove: <link rel="stylesheet" href="rtl.css" /> from <head>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with Hebrew placeholder text
2. **Add actual Hebrew content** when ready
3. **Fine-tune spacing** for Hebrew characters
4. **Test on mobile devices**
5. **Validate accessibility** for Hebrew screen readers

## Support

For issues with RTL implementation:
- Check browser console for CSS conflicts
- Verify all HTML files have proper RTL attributes
- Ensure rtl.css loads after all other stylesheets
- Test with Hebrew keyboard input

## Performance Notes

- RTL CSS is lightweight (~3KB)
- No JavaScript dependencies
- Works offline once cached
- Compatible with existing animations and transitions
