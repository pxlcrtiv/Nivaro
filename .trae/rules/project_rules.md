i want the contents of the website to be Right To Left instead of Left To Right. the reason is that later i will manually convert all the texts to hebrew as the webite is going to be for hebrew users.
this website will be for native hebrew speakers
this website is for brand name Nivaro
this project ws originally a NExt js project i cloned it using httrack and i now want to customize the files i have gotten to suit the brand Nivaro, i do not to chanage it back to react or next js. i'm okay with it being in html css and js .
this project is also deployed to firebase hosting.
